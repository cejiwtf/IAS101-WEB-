# Secure Web Application with Flask

A secure web application with user authentication, role-based access control, and password strength validation.

## Features
- User registration and login with password hashing (bcrypt)
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)
- Protected routes with Flask-Login
- Password strength meter with real-time feedback
- Input validation to prevent XSS and SQL injection
- Security headers implementation
- Default admin user creation

- We still need to check the admin panel. 
- We already have the password hashing.
